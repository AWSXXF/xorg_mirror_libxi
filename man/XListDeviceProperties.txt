DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XListDeviceProperties function returns a list of the
   properties associated with the input device specified in
   device. Each device may have an arbitrary number of properties
   attached, some of which were created by the driver and/or
   server, others created by clients at runtime.

   The client is expected to free the list of properties using
   XFree.

   XListDeviceProperties can generate a BadDevice error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadAtom
          A value does not describe a valid named identifier.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          window.

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The device does not
          exist.
